## Installation

Get [node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) if you donâ€™t have them already.

Install dependencies:

`npm install`

### Running the dev server

`npm run dev`

You should then be able to connect useing a browser to *localhost:3000*

### Building

`npm run export`

This will put a static version of the site in `out/`. 
This does not seem to work as the paths get messed up. 
Since what is being run is `next build` followed by `next export` a solution may or may not be found [here](https://nextjs.org/docs#static-html-export).
